# VM Migration Notes (lessons learned)

## Current Migration Status (as of latest update)

### Successfully Migrated to VM Pattern
- **Creation component** - Uses VM arrow data with fallback values and comprehensive parity checking
- **Interaction component** - Uses VM arrow data with fallback values and comprehensive parity checking
- **InteractionAsync component** - Already uses VM arrow data
- **Divider component** - Uses VM data for width, translateX, and styling with comprehensive parity checking
- **Return component** - Successfully migrated from `useArrow` hook to `calculateArrowGeometry` direct usage

### Migration Completed
ðŸŽ‰ **All components have been successfully migrated away from the `useArrow` hook!**

- All components now use `calculateArrowGeometry` directly instead of the `useArrow` React hook
- `useArrow` hook has been removed from active use (kept for backward compatibility only)
- Components have been refactored to use a dedicated `arrowGeometry.ts` module
- All migration goals achieved without breaking Playwright tests

### Parity Checking Implementation
All migrated components now include comprehensive parity checking that:
- Compares VM-provided values against fallback calculations
- Logs warnings when mismatches exceed tolerance (0.1px for numeric values)
- Logs success messages with âœ“ when values match within tolerance
- Includes detailed diagnostic information for debugging mismatches
- Covers all geometric properties (translateX, interactionWidth, rightToLeft, layer counts)
- Includes styling validation for Divider component

### Migration Lessons

- **Return semantics** â€“ Bare `return x;` expressions lack an explicit target in the current IR. When the VM assumes `data-to`/`target`, the renderer creates a self-message loop. Any VM rework must either extend the IR with a `returnTo` concept or retain a parser-context fallback to distinguish plain returns.

- **Arrow geometry** â€“ âœ… **RESOLVED**: All components successfully migrated from `useArrow` hook to direct `calculateArrowGeometry` usage. Components now use memoized calculations with proper dependency management, eliminating the React hook overhead while maintaining the same geometry calculations.

- **Playwright snapshots** â€“ Visual diffs generally signaled real regressions (arrow orientation, widths, numbering). Before updating baselines, inspect the DOM and fix the root cause.

- **Incremental strategy** â€“ Migrating all message types together multiplies regression risk. Instead, convert one type end-to-end (IR â†’ VM â†’ component â†’ tests), stabilize it, then proceed to the next.

- **Locator expectations** â€“ Tests assert attributes like `data-target`, `data-type`, and numbering. VM changes that restructure data must update the tests in tandem or keep those attributes intact.

- **Rollback hygiene** â€“ Keeping the old context-based components intact makes it easy to revert when regressions surface. Prefer a clean switch (all VM or all context) rather than partial hybrids.
- **Range-driven highlighting** â€“ Highlight state should be derived from the VM-provided statement `range`. Keeping cursor math inside the component caused drift once contexts disappeared, so always lift that information into the VM lookup before rendering.
