# Understanding ANTLR4's Optional Block Warning

## TL;DR

Don't have `(A? B?)?` in your ANTLR4 grammar.

## The Warning

ANTLR4 may produce the following warning:

```
rule containsOptionalBlock contains an optional block with at least one alternative that can match an empty string
```

This warning occurs when a rule contains an optional block that can potentially match an empty string.

## Example

Consider the following rule:

```antlr4
falseWarning: IF condition (THEN? ELSE?)? ENDIF;
```

## Explanation

The warning is triggered because the optional block `(THEN? ELSE?)?` can match an empty string in two scenarios:

1. When the entire optional block is absent.
2. When the block is present, but both `THEN` and `ELSE` are absent.

This can lead to ambiguity during parsing. If the input lacks both `THEN` and `ELSE`, the parser can't determine whether it matched an empty optional block or skipped it entirely.

## Solutions

To resolve this warning, ensure at least one part of the optional block is mandatory. Here are some approaches:

1. Make `THEN` mandatory:

   ```antlr4
   falseWarning: IF condition (THEN ELSE?)? ENDIF;
   ```

2. Require at least one of `THEN` or `ELSE`:

   ```antlr4
   falseWarning: IF condition ((THEN | ELSE) ELSE?)? ENDIF;
   ```

3. Split into separate rules:
   ```antlr4
   falseWarning: IF condition thenElseBlock? ENDIF;
   thenElseBlock: THEN | ELSE | THEN ELSE;
   ```

By implementing one of these solutions, you ensure the optional block cannot match an empty string, resolving the ANTLR4 warning.
